Hello marker! I was focus on my codes and testing results until I saw the SVN marking criterion, hope it's not too late to comment on my codes.

So far, I've made check_len(), check_with(), check_without(), check_pattern() functions to check the parameter of input, and left -alphabet and -best in the main function, which will be fixed later.

Also, I have patter_err(), dict_err() (to be finished later), usg_err() to report errors in this program.

next, I will write open_dict() function to replace those parts in main.

Now, I'm fixing contain_checking() function to filter -with and -without outputs.

My aim is to completely run this program first to satisfy funtionality, and then structure it appropriately. last two suggested approach to finished, test 1-6 almost finished!

Anyway, new to C and have learned a lot! Keep going tomorrow!

finished contain_checking() function, which will check if a word contains -with input, which facilitates this program to print the dictionary that contains -with input

test 1-6 all pass, to do -without input next!

have finished exclude_checking() function, which checks if a word excludes letters in after parameter "-without"
all test from 1-8 are passed, all suggested approaches completed.

next, should fix the bug that this program can't correctly distinguish "-with" and "-without" when the input are same, and try advance functionality.
nice job, keep going!

Integrate all functions well and successfully pass all tests except sorting.

Initialized 'c' to be zero and check after while looping file reading to know if some words are read,
then initialized 'a' to zero to check if any words are printed. By doing so to know if exit(4) should be implemented.

Next, trying to challenge dynamic memory to store each word that should be print.

Generally, 80% of work are done, keep going and good luck to myself.
