psclient

Enum some exit codes and the position of command line parameters.

Define a structure Parameters to hold the arguments from command line.

Create a function valid_name() that checks if the name argument is valid or not, if the name includes ' ', ';', or '\n' then it is invalid.

Create parse_command_line() that handles command line arguments, if errors exist in those arguments, the programme will exit as it suppose to be, otherwise it returns parameter values in a structure.

Create receiving() to receive data from server, this function is to be used in multi-thread that some thread will call this function.

Create send_to_server() to send data received from stdin to server, this function is to be call by threads.

In the main function, it opens a socket and try to connect to the port that specified in the command line, it also spawns two threads to handle the data from stdin and data from server at the same time.

Start programming psserver.c

#include useful libraries and #define useful macros to avoid magic numbers.

Add a enum for parameter positions to avoid magic numbers.

Add a enum for exit code to avoid magic numbers.

define a structure that holds the parameters from command line.

create a function usage_err() to handle usage errors, this is to avoid repeat codes.

create parse_command_line() to parse command line parameters. This function will check if the command line arguments are valid and return the params structure including port numbers and connection numbers.

Create open_listen() to listen to a port, this function will occur error when the port cannot listen toand print error messages. It will return the file descriptor that associates to the listening port.

Create check_valid() to check the information that server receives are valid or not.

create client_thread() to handle the connection from clients.

create process_connection() to handle the connection process, it will accpet connection after opening a listening port.

Add <stringmap.h> library.

Define a structure ThreadArgs to handle multi-threads later.

Define a structure Node to help in link list later.

Define a structure LinkedList as a data structure to be used in StringMap.

Define a structure Client to hold client information.

Set SOMAXCONN to maximize possible listening port.

Create process_sub() to handle the "sub" information received from clients. Similarly, I also create process_pub(), process_unsub() to handle "pub" and "unsub" commands.

Create process_communication() to handle all received informations from clients. It will validate if the command is valid and then process it.

Add semaphore to client_thread() to help thread safe.

Add more values in process_connection() to help thread handling.

The server can now correctly handle communication protocol.

Remove tail node from LinkedList, not use it here.

Clean some unused memory allocations.

In "sub", "pub", "unsub" functions, now use an indicator to indicator the position in a linkedList.

I just got feedback from A3 that I should commit more often rather than a big commit, I promise will do that next time...

Add <signal.h> library to handle signals.

Add macro to avoid magic numbers when using split_by_char function.

Add http error exit code in enum ExitCode.

Create an enum of space numbers that "pub", "sub", "unsub" suppose to have, which is helpful to avoid magic numbers.

Add statistics parameters to ThreadArgs to handle the statistics when receiving a sighup.

Replace many magic numbers to meaningful symbols.

Fix some style problems that to many spaces in next line.

Create a function find_space_nums() to find how many space is in a line, which is helpful to reduce lines from the previous function, to achieve style requirement.

Change the input of process_sub/pub/unsub from StringMap to a thread argument struct, which is helpful in handling statistics.

Create sighup_handling to handle SIGHUP signal, which will print the statistics to stderr when the server receives SIGHUP.

Add an extra thread to process_connection to handle SIGHUP.

Create open_http_listen to listen http port when the variable is specified.

Create process_http_connection() to handle http connections.

Add http listen and process connection function to main function.
